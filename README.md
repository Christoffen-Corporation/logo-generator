The "small" set of scripts and C files scrapped together using redneck hacks back in October 2015 is growing up to be a big boy!!

This project has helped me learn how to write a program that's useful while at the same time extending to help me learn about the GNU Autotools, argp, Cairo (where it started), Gtk+, along with some other stuff. This is stuff colleges probably told people at one point they'd be lost without, but I'm only just getting out of the 11th grade.

This file is being re-written. Thanks for your patience.
